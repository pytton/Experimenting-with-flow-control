Builds and runs without issues
This has been put into a new solution on April 17th 2016.
Using settings that worked previously.
Headers + source files in 'src' folder.
Do not modify files in src/FLUID - these are used by FLUID, an FLTK editor.
The header file and source file in src/FLUID must be included in the project for it to work.
